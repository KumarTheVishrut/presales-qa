5. **🛠️ Mention two skills essential for success in presales.**  
   ➤ Two crucial skills for excelling in presales are:  
   - **Technical Expertise** 🧠: To architect solutions, run POCs, and confidently address questions.

6. **🏢 Why is a dedicated presales team crucial in B2B sales?**  
   ➤ In B2B scenarios, sales cycles are often **long, technical, and involve multiple stakeholders**.

8. **📄 What is the primary purpose of an RFP (Request for Proposal)?**  
   ➤ An RFP is a formal document issued by potential customers that outlines their requirements and invites vendors to submit proposals. Its purpose is to **facilitate structured evaluation** across vendors based on functionality, price, delivery timelines, and support.

9. **🎯 Why is goal-setting important in discovery sessions?**  
   ➤ Setting clear goals during discovery ensures that the conversation stays focused on solving the **customer’s most critical challenges**. It also allows you to identify what success looks like and to tailor your demo and proposal accordingly.

10. **💡 What is the main difference between solution selling and value-based selling?**  
    ➤ **Solution selling** focuses on addressing a customer’s problem by matching it with a specific product or feature set.  
    ➤ **Value-based selling** goes a step further by **quantifying the impact** of solving that problem (e.g., increased revenue, saved time, reduced costs). It emphasizes outcomes, not just outputs.
